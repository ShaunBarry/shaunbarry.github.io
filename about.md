I'm a 3rd year undergraduate student at Drexel University currently studying Electrical Engineering in the accelerated B.S.M.S. program. It is a 5-year program with (3) 6-month co-op's. I'm a member of  

My research interests include using machine learning and signal processing to generate interesting music. I've spent my first 2 co-op opportunities at Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories (ATL) where I've developed Deep Learning algorithms for applications in cognitive electronic warfare. I have one more 6 month co-op opportunity from late March, 2018 until late September, 2018. I will graduate in June, 2019.

I'm also an undergraduate volunteer researcher in [The Music and Entertainment Technology Laboratory (MET-lab)][http://www.met-lab.org/] at Drexel. My advisor is Dr. Youngmoo Kim.
