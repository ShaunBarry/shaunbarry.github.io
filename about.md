I'm a 3rd year undergraduate student at Drexel University currently studying Electrical Engineering in the accelerated B.S.M.S., 5-year, 3 co-op program.

My research interests include using machine learning and signal processing to generate interesting music, and using learning algortihms to help perform related tasks. I also work at Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories (ATL) where I've contributed to projects using Deep Learning in cognitive electronic warfare.
