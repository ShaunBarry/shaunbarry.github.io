I'm a 3rd year undergraduate student at Drexel University currently studying Electrical Engineering in an accelerated B.S.M.S. program. I'm enrolled in their 5 year co-op program. 

My research is focused on developing generative algorithms for music. I also work at Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories where I've contributed to projects using Deep Learning in communications.
